# Derzhavets_bot concept

## Individual voting
In be specific, predefined moments in time (with `celery`) the Bot can send messages to all of the users with a voting keyboard attached (inline keyboards).
## Noting the presence (“I’m here” button)
In the specific moment in time (usually when a lecture starts) users will get a single message with a keyboard (inline keyboard) that they have to click on in order to tell the Bot that they are present [on the lecture].
## Situation scenario
As well as with voting, users will get the sequence of messages, when every other is defined by the user’s input (user’s choice) in the previous message (reply keyboards).
**Scenarios are predefined.**
## Extra questions with text input
The bot is be able to save the user's input for the specific messages (usually, task messages) to the Database.
## Saving data to the Database
The Bot saves all the important clicks, as well as the date and time of the clicks, to the Database.
